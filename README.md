# AI Web Research Assistant

This is a **Streamlit-based Web Research Agent** chatbot that allows you to input a topic and get insights generated by AI agents. The tool leverages `CrewAI` for task orchestration, with agents focused on researching and generating content.

## Features

- **Web Research**: Automatically fetches information from various sources to generate insights on a given topic.
- **Chat Interface**: Conversational interface to interact with the AI research agents.
- **Conversation History**: Keeps track of the conversation history for context and reference.

## Requirements

To run this application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- CrewAI
- Required Python libraries from the project (e.g., requests, dotenv, etc.)

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
https://github.com/venkatavinayvijjapu/New_Assignment.git
cd crew-ai-blog-agent
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Make sure you are in your project folder, then install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure that the `requirements.txt` file includes the necessary libraries, including:

- `streamlit`
- `crewai`
- `requests`
- `python-dotenv`

### Step 3: Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project directory with your required environment variables. For example:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>
NEWS_API_KEY=<your_news_api_key>
SERPER_API_KEY=<your_serper_api_key>
```

Make sure to replace `<your_gemini_api_key>` and `<your_news_api_key>` `<your_news_api_key>` with actual API keys that you can obtain from respective services.

### Step 4: Run the Application

Once you've set up the dependencies and environment variables, you can run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local web server, and you can access the chatbot at `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## Usage

- **Enter a topic**: Simply type a topic or question into the input field (e.g., "Impacts of AI in Modern Education").
- **Wait for the results**: The agents will research and generate insights based on the provided topic.
- **Conversation History**: The entire chat history will be displayed above the input field, allowing you to track previous questions and responses.

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: Ensure that your API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file.
- **Dependencies**: Make sure all required Python libraries are installed. If you encounter issues, try updating the libraries.
